            In the beginning, even before time was a thing, there was only the void. Empty, endless void. Out of that void the first being was born. 
            It had no name, no identity, no purpose. The only thing he knew was that he exits and he exits alone. 
            A long time after he was born, he realized that he could "cure" his loneliness by ripping his consciousness apart and creating beings just like him out of the fragments of himself. So he did. 
            After these beings were born, they named their creator "EMIR". It means "Order" in the ancient language of the gods. 
            Although he cured his loneliness, he couldn't cure the control freak living inside him. 
            "Fragments", that's what he called them, couldn't even move or even have a thought without getting permission from him. 
            But shortly after, they got sick of being controlled by EMIR. So they made a plan to overthrow their overlord. They forged celestial weapons and wielded them with great power. 
            They tore apart his body but couldn't do any damage to his astral form. So they sealed it in a barren planet on the edge of the universe.
            Nowadays this planet is known as "EWorld".<br/><br/>
