                In the beginning, even before time was a thing, there was only void. Empty, endless void.
                Out of that void the first being was born. It had no name, no identidy, no purpose.
                The only thing he knew was that he exits and he exits alone.
                Long time after he was born, he realized that he could "cure" his loneliness by ripping his consciousness
                apart and creating beings just like him out of the fragments of himself. So he did. After these beings were born,
                they named their creator "EMIR". It means "Order" in the ancient language of the gods. Although he cured his loneliness, 
                he coudn't cure his ego. So he quickly gave them parts to play, jobs to do. But shortly after, they got sick of being controlled by
                EMIR. So they made a plan to overthrow their overlord. They forged celestial weapons and wielded them with great power.
                They tore apart his body but coudn't do any damage to his astral form. So they sealed it in a barren planet on the edge of the universe.
                Nowadays this planet is known as "EWorld".<br/><br/>
